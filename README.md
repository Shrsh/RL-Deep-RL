# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
This repository has been divided into two sections(RL and Deep RL). All the algorithms implemented in repository are implemented for OpenAI-Gym environments. 
Reinforcement Learning Algorithms: 
- Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation 
- Monte Carlo epsilon greedy on-policy Control
- SARSA (Coming Soon)
- Q Learning (Coming Soon)

Deep RL:
- Traning a Deep-Q Network on Atari Breakout and analysis.
