# Deep Q Network 
This code and report was completed as a course assignment. 

#### Train a DQN to play Atari 2600 Breakout.You need to train upto 2000-4000 episodes (12-18 hrs) to get some decent performance from your network. There will huge variation between two runs with different random seeds. So be patientand perform multiple runs. Take advantage of Google Colab [7] (with checkpoints) or Ada [8]. Your report should contain the following.
- A plot showing the performance of your DQN. x and y axis should
indicate number of time-steps and mean reward for past 30 episodes
respectively. You may also use other metrics used in [2]. Add a
video/gif link showing your networks final performance.
- After the network is trained, show 3-5 screen shots of the game, cor-
responding input to network, Q-values for each action correspond-
ing to that input. Briefly explain your observations.
- Choose one hyper-parameter (loss function, learning rate, input rep-
resentation, exploration policy parameter, .. etc) that you expect to
affect the performance of Q-network. Run at-least two more experi-
ments by varying this hyper parameter and comment on the perfor-
mance of the network with plots. Mention your reasoning for the
choice of hyper parameter.
